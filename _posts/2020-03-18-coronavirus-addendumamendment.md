Form is not mandatory.

It's an addendum to a new contract, or amendment to an existing contract.

Rather than risk an uncertain outcome in court or arbitration over such disputes, Buyers and Sellers may elect to address the unanswered issues contractually. This form allows parties to agree on a way forward for existing contracts and address potential issues in contracts that have not yet been formed.

Can be used to remove the Notice to Perform and Demand to Close requirement.

Can be used to allow buyer to cancel, even after having removed loan contingency.&nbsp;
