Dear Current or Future Real Estate Agent,

Are you thinking of starting a career in real estate? Or are you a brand-new agent just starting out in the business? Or a top-producing agent who’s paying your broker way too much money?

No matter what your situation is, there are certain challenges you may find yourself facing, including:

* Lack of support from your current broker or team leader
* Lack of training and resources
* Being in a sink or swim environment
* Feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, and defeated
* Dealing with brokerages that don’t properly educate or equip their agents
* Contending with real estate disruptors (OpenDoor, Zillow, Redfin, etc.) trying to take business from you

&nbsp;

With all of these challenges, it’s easy to see why roughly 87% of all agents fail within their first year in business.

To avoid becoming a part of this statistic, some agents join the wrong team because they’re promised leads and training. They also do things like hire coaches, take classes to earn meaningless designations, join Facebook groups, and waste money on social media marketing.

What keeps these agents up at 3 a.m. is a lack of consistent, predictable income. They also lack committed buyers and sellers. They live paycheck to paycheck, always wondering whether they should just cut their losses and fall back into a regular 9-to-5 job.

They find themselves on the entrepreneurial roller coaster, with all the income fluctuations, lack of funds, depression, and wasted time and money that come with it. Going back to that regular 9-to-5 job means forgoing the comfortable lifestyle they once dreamed of.

The good news is, I have a solution that will keep you from being a part of the 87%. I’m inviting you to join our team.

My name is Josh Painter, and throughout my real estate career, we’ve built a brokerage of 50 agents, and our team is consistently ranked high in the State of California. We have a proven track record of turning brand new agents into top producers. Our job is helping agents become the very best versions of themselves, both personally and in business. We’ve been through all of the ups and downs this industry has to offer, and we're here to help you take the next step in your career.

Our solution involves top-tier coaching, training, high-quality leads, a robust CRM to manage your database, an in-house ISA, agent masterminds, weekly accountability and goal-tracking, a fully prepared listing presentation, and a system of automated follow-up measures to streamline prospecting.

Our company is unique because we believe in using business as a force for good. We don’t just focus on real estate—we focus on personal development across the board. Unlike other team leaders, we're not trying to take credit for our agents listings and production—we help agents build their business. We spend thousands of dollars on marketing, setting appointments, and qualifying buyers and sellers. We know what works and what doesn’t.

You’ll get real-life training, experience, accountability, and coaching. You’ll also be provided with leads and resources to grow your business. We generate referrals from past clients, our local community, business partners, family and friends, and other agents across the country. All agents ultimately want predictable income, confidence, success, and accountability, and we guarantee all of these things.

Of course, you always have other options. You could join another team where the leader takes credit for all of your listings and sales in the MLS to build their own business, or a team with a high turnover rate and little coaching and training. There are also plenty of low-fee brokerages out there that offer little support, or multi-level marketing companies who promise stock options but charge a huge split, or “100% commission brokerages.” The thing is: 100% of nothing is still nothing.

But don’t just take our word for it. Consider the stories of our top agents from 2019:

* Garrett went from making $2,000 per month as a bartender to selling 65 homes, winning "Agent of the Year", and earning over $300,000 per year.
* Shishana sold 51 homes, was voted “Most Loved Agent”, was featured as a top agent in Inland Empire Magazine, and earns over $300,000 per year.
* Brad went from serving wine to being voted “Rookie of the Year” and earns over $150,000 per year.

To sum it up, our offer is simple: If you join our team, you’ll get coaching, mentorship, training, accountability, leads, a CRM, and an easy-going, accessible broker who has his pulse on the industry.

If you take us up on this offer, our assistant will get you set up with our CRM so you can start prospecting and getting leads and appointments right away. You’ll have access to all of our top agents and training database, and we’ll enroll you in a custom business-planning and goal-setting course. By committing to our program, we guarantee you’ll increase your production every year.

Every day you wait is another day you fall behind. If you’re interested in making a career move that will change your life, reach out to us soon and let’s schedule a one-on-one meeting.

We look forward to hearing from you soon\!

Sincerely,

Josh Painter & Impact Real Estate
